         Interesting Facts, arranged Alphabetically by Subjects


  =This compilation is an attempt by a busy library staff to put
  into form convenient for use a large group of such facts and figures
  as experience shows are often asked for. The notes which follow tell
  how we happen to be so interested in Newark's story, why so many
  questions on that story come to us, and what kind of help we hope
  Newarkers may get from it.=

About seventeen years ago the Library began to collect information about
Newark. We began with a search for good topical poetry and for historical
stories so written as to appeal to young people. Of these we found very
little; though poor verse and poor history were both abundant.

Then we extended our search to the field of Newark as a going concern. In
this field we found so little in print that was fairly descriptive of the
actual Newark of the time, from water supply to sewers, and from parks to
jails, that we began to write it ourselves.

We were moved to do this largely because certain changes in school work
led many pupils and teachers to come to us for information. Our brief,
typed and multigraphed statements about subjects like the city hospital,
paving and street cleaning, proved to be very welcome. We gathered a vast
deal of Newark information and, in time, cast much of it into convenient
form for use in the Library and for lending. In these days we held in the
Library several annual exhibits illustrative of and calling attention to
events of both early and recent days in Newark's history.

Mr. Frank J. Urquhart, one of the editors of the Newark Sunday Call, had
long been an advocate of the study of Newark by its citizens, both old
and young. At the request of the Library, he wrote a brief history of
Newark for the use of young people, which later the Board of Education
adopted as a text-book in the schools. Mr. Urquhart helped the Library
very materially in the collection of historical data and in exhibits of
Newark life and customs in the past.

Several years ago the schools took over this Newark work and, of course,
vastly expanded it, and made of it a Course, running through all grades,
on the City of Newark, and supplied for it a text-book and more than
forty pamphlets of Newark information.

Dr. A. B. Poland, then Superintendent of our Schools, approved
heartily of all this Newark study work, and at his request Assistant
Superintendent J. Wilmer Kennedy prepared the Course of Study and the
pamphlets just mentioned.

The demand for Newark information which came to the Library was, of
course, rather increased than diminished by this adoption of a Newark
Study Course by the schools.

Moreover, Newark has now a much larger number of persons who are
interested in its development and its character and its recent
self-improvement than it had fifteen years ago. Consequently, the
requests received from adults for facts and figures concerning recent
events in our city are much more numerous than they were formerly.

Looking back over the world's history with the perspective of many years,
you would not find it an easy matter to select any fifteen-year period
about which you might wish to write even the briefest review. That is,
events appear to lose their importance or to produce unexpected results
with the passing years, and only a comparatively few happenings remain
conspicuous for all time and for all peoples.

There is, however, a peculiar fascination about history in the making,
and especially local history within one's own memory. Perhaps it may
be compared to the study of a dead language as an intellectual pursuit
and the study of a live language for the pleasure or profit of human
intercourse. Both are desirable--the one, as a background, the other, as
a foreground of education.

Newark's history from the days of Robert Treat was so thoroughly reviewed
at the time of the 250th Anniversary Celebration, 1916, that we have
elected to treat as background everything prior to 1904 and to concern
ourselves with the story of Newark from that year to the present. This
means that the high school graduate of June, 1919, should find between
the covers of this pamphlet a record of the city from the time he or
she entered the kindergarten. With these dates in mind it was really
astonishing to find how many changes and what material advances had been
made within the fifteen years. As you thought of the building of the
City Hall and Court House; the changed appearance of the "Four Corners";
the opening of the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes; the new Public Service
Terminal; the adaptation of automatic appliances in fire fighting; the
impetus given movements like "Safety First", vacant lot cultivation and
thrift with its school banks; the bigger civic undertakings like City
Plan, Passaic Valley Sewer; Port Newark and the unexpected trend of its
development due to the war; the war itself, representing the effect of
a world event on a city's activities; the 250th Anniversary, a local
celebration, but illustrative of Newark's relations with the outside
world; and, finally, of the change of city administration to Commission
Government--you wonder whether history at close range invariably presents
so much of interest, or whether 1904-1919 happens to be a particularly
progressive period, or whether Newark, suddenly conscious of its
backwardness in many lines, is now making up for lost time.

So many facts presented themselves that the pamphlet soon outgrew our
original conception of it, becoming much larger than was originally
intended. It is still, however, a succession of facts and in no sense a
consecutive history. Because it grew from fact to fact, suggested by one
assistant and perhaps set down by another; and because from the first
day the idea was suggested to the day when work stopped, a lapse of
three months, we were daily expecting that copy must go to the printer
on the morrow, the entries are not as complete, or the whole as well
balanced as we should wish. One consideration which delayed our work, but
which should contribute to any value it may have, was the fixed desire
to avoid loose, indefinite statement and to resist the inclination to
make irrelevant comment when real information is wanting or difficult to
acquire. This determination grew as our own searches and questionings
showed how common is this looseness of statement. For the facts and
information which it was impossible or very difficult to get from records
on file, we wish to make grateful acknowledgment to city departments,
newspapers, societies and individuals who responded promptly and
graciously to our calls for assistance.

each may make alternate use of classroom, court and auditorium. Makes for
economy in erection of buildings, since under the alternate plan, it is
possible to accommodate in any fully equipped building from 40% to 50%
more pupils than under the regular system. Broader curriculum with longer
school day. Modification of the "Wirt" system practiced in the schools of

1900, as far as the first records show, there were not more than 10 or 12

1798. Legislature incorporated it under name of Mayor and Common Council
of _City_ of Newark, 1836. The 1857 revision, authorized by act of
Legislature, embodied all changes made since 1836.

Mayor Haussling appointed a committee which formulated and published
draft of new city charter, 1911.

Mayor Raymond appointed "Charter Revision Commission", which presented
its proposed charter to Legislature, 1917. It provided for a mayor, and
Commission of five, elected at large. Mayor to have veto power and to
appoint heads of departments. This was defeated in Assembly, March, 1917.

See also Commission Government.


_Child Hygiene Division, Board of Health_: Established Aug., 1913, to
supervise care of new-born babies, to study causes of infant mortality
and to teach art and science of mothercraft. Chief, 4 clinic physicians
and 14 nurses now in attendance. Has continued work of consultation
stations, formerly directed by general board, at which advice is given
expectant mothers and mothers of children up to school age. Supervises
boarding-homes of infants up to 3 years of age, which by ordinance of

mothers and is planning convalescent home for them at Ivy Hill.

A supervisor of midwives was appointed Nov., 1914, to investigate and
report on practice of midwifery and has continued to direct work of
midwives, who attend 50% of the births of the city.


_Christmas Trees, Municipal_: The first tree, a Norway spruce, 48 ft.
high, with spread of 30 ft., was set up in Military Park, Christmas,
1913. Illuminated at night with 800 electric lights, and 50 in star shape
at top. Week of festival followed. Similar festivities held around trees
set up in the park next 2 years.

In 1916 a great Norway spruce was set up in south lawn fronting City
Hall. Inside the building, a smaller tree was placed in rotunda for week
of festival. These City Hall Christmas Festivals brought together old
and young, rich and poor, for singing and games and Christmas good cheer
of all kinds. For the past 2 years there has been no municipal Christmas
Tree, but Christmas festivities have been held in the City Hall.


_Churches_: Items of church history,--buildings erected, parish houses
annexed, missions established, etc.,--are too numerous to be recorded in
a brief, general outline. Detailed sketches of individual churches have
been written by Rev. Joseph F. Folsom and appended to Urquhart's History
of Newark, Vol. II., pp. 949-1020.


_City Home_: See Delinquent Children.


_City Plan Commission_: "City planning means development of our city
according to carefully prepared plans; stopping all further random
development, all haphazard extensions, and all improvements for certain
favored sections or limited localities. It means considering every
suggested change or improvement as to its effect on the entire city and
all suburbs and nearby towns.

"City planning is for all, and especially for the man of modest income.
It means better housing and attractive and healthful surroundings for
the humblest homes. It means securing for the cheapest tenement the
sunny, airy, sanitary conditions which health, science and common sense
demand.

"It means a City Efficient, a City Clean and a City Enjoyable."

An act providing for city plan commissions passed N. J. Legislature and
became a law March 30, 1911. On June 1, Mayor Haussling appointed the
Newark City Plan Commission. For its investigations and work, $10,000 was
annually appropriated until the adoption of Commission Government. Under
this form of government there were no further appropriations for special
boards and the City Plan Commission went out of existence, Dec. 31, 1917.

Some of the subjects studied and reported on by the Commission aside
from street arrangement, were Centre Market, Housing Problems, Municipal
Recreation, Interurban Improvement and Harbor Development. The Commission
issued "City Planning for Newark" and "A Comprehensive Plan". Both are
valuable documents and rich in Newark facts.


_Civil Service Reform_: The system by which public offices are filled
and promotions made through competitive examinations held under federal,
state or city government. It is known as the "merit system", since
it looks toward the appointment of men to office because of their
competency. It is a reaction from the "spoils system" or the practice
of giving public offices to political favorites. The state measure was
adopted, 1910, by Newark, by popular vote.


_Coal Shortage_: 27,000 emergency coal cards, entitling each person to
1,000 pounds of coal, were issued by Bd. of Health during coal shortage
in the winter of 1917-18. U. S. government instituted Workless Mondays to
conserve coal, and boards of education closed school buildings for lack
of fuel.


_College of Technology_: See Technical School.


_Comfort Stations_: First public comfort station, in Military Park, ready
for use July, 1910. Cost $14,734. Maintained by Shade Tree Commission,
now a division of Dept. of Parks and Public Property.


_Commission Government_: Adopted Oct. 9, 1917, at a special referendum
election. Vote 19,069 for, and 6,053 against.

Present commissioners elected Nov. 13, 1917, to serve until May, 1921,
are:

  Mayor Charles P. Gillen. Dept. of Public Affairs.

  Alexander Archibald. Dept. of Revenue and Finance.

  William J. Brennan. Dept. of Public Safety.

  Thomas L. Raymond. Dept. of Streets and Public Improvements.

Change of government authorized under Walsh Act, passed by the N. J.
Legislature April 25, 1911. 5 commissioners, elected by the people and
responsible to them, replace a mayor, 32 common council members, numerous
departments and boards. The commission names one of its members to be
mayor. He becomes chief Commissioner, but has no veto power.


_Contemporary, The_: Organized April 23, 1909, by representatives of
Sesame, Philomathean, Irving, Saturday and Municipal Art Clubs. To meet
need for single large organization of Newark women, working toward a
better knowledge of civic conditions and for the development of good
fellowship among women.

204 active and 198 associate members enrolled at first regular meeting,
Oct. 19, 1909. Admitted to State Federation of Women's Clubs, Oct. 24,
1909. Legally incorporated, April 19, 1915. Total membership, Sept.,
1918, was 1,461.

Among its activities have been the institution of a social hygiene
movement; the organization of the Housewives' League; advocacy of the
founding of a State College for Women; opening a boarding home for
girls; and work for prison reform, mothers' pensions, child welfare and
delinquency, emergency relief and food conservation.

of Industrial Arts. Wrappers from several department stores given lessons
in salesmanship during working hours without loss of wages.

Educational and cultural value of manual arts recognized by requiring
them in all curricula. Arts curriculum carrying full credit in music and
art introduced as major subjects. All other courses modified and adjusted
to meet more adequately needs of students preparing for office, shop,
home or higher institution of learning.


_Crippled Children, School for_: Opened July 7, 1912 in Home for Crippled
Children. 17 pupils ranging in age from 4 to 13 years. Heretofore no
schooling had been provided.

School with 11 pupils, 1910. In Oct., 1915, classes in lip-reading for
adults were organized as part of evening school program.


_Death Rate_: Statistics for this period are noteworthy because they show
effects of infantile paralysis epidemic in 1916, and of influenza in
1918, which, though less alarming in its symptoms, had more fatal results.

           _Population_  _No. Deaths_   _Death Rate_
     1904     272,000        5,378         19.77

_Juvenile Delinquency_: See Delinquent Children.


_Lectures, Public_: 25 years ago, the lecture system was a feature of the
evening schools, and continued as such, until 1906, when it was decided
to have the lectures for the people given in school buildings, designated
as lecture centers. In 1907 there were 15 lecture centers, including
the First Presbyterian Church, the Free Public Library and 13 school
buildings.

During the season of 1907-08 there were 245 lectures with a total
attendance of 105,210. For the season 1915-16 there were 30 centers and
400 lectures, with an aggregate attendance of 160,890. During the war
period, 1917-18, the attendance decreased.

Subjects treated in the lectures are history, patriotism, art, music,
literature and geography. Many are illustrated by stereopticon views and
a few by motion pictures. Musical programs have always proved popular.


_Library, Public_: Building completed, March, 1901. Cost of building,
$315,000; cost of land, $100,000. Architects, Rankin & Kellogg,
Philadelphia.

Number of books lent in 1904, 465,674. In 1911 the number passed the
million mark and held it until, in 1918, the library's income was found
to be inadequate, branch libraries were closed, and the number of books
lent dropped, accordingly, 37%.

Art Department and Picture Collection, which were getting well under way
in 1904 and lent 3,000 pictures that year, now lend over 100,000 small
pictures, photographs, lithographs and prints. These pictures are used
by teachers in 36 different schools for classroom work; also by artists,
designers, jewelers, newspapers and journals, advertising men and others
in trades and professions, needing illustrative material.

Barringer High School Branch. Opened, 1900, under management of Public
Library. Management taken over by Bd. of Education and books purchased
from the Public Library, 1915.

Business Branch. First opened in 1904 at 16 Academy St., with a
collection of directories and a general book collection. First public
library of business literature and information for business men ever
established. Similar branches have since been established by libraries
of other large cities. During the 15 years it moved 4 times, always near
the business center at Broad and Market Streets, and special development
along business lines has been steadily carried on.

Branch Libraries, General. Delivery stations were the Library's first
attempt to reach people in sections distant from the main building.
They were opened in drug stores at various centers as early as 1891 and
were intended only for the collection and delivery of books borrowed by
people in the neighborhood. Readers left their cards with a list of call
numbers, taken from the old "finding list" or printed catalog. Requests
were filled at the Library and books delivered to the station daily.

In 1906, because of increased use, delivery stations were replaced
by deposit stations. At these deposit stations, still operated in
stores, the Library placed collections of several hundred books and
continued the delivery system. When the lending of books outgrew deposit
stations, branch libraries were the natural result. After branches were
established, deposit stations were discontinued, Nov., 1914.

From 1905 to 1915, seven general branches in rented stores and two school
branches, were opened for the convenience of residents in neighborhoods
two or more miles from the main library. All branches closed in 1918
because of insufficient funds to carry on the work, which had grown to
large proportions. For notes about branches, see chronological "Story of
the Branches", in pamphlet "The Roseville Branch", published 1917.

Children's Books. The Children's Room at the Main Library always has a
special collection of children's books to lend to children who live near
enough to visit it. The branch libraries lent books also to children in
their neighborhoods. The School Dept. sends to any teacher who wishes it,
a school or classroom library of 25-40 books to lend to the children in
her class. 400 or 500 of these libraries go into schools every year and
15,000 children read the books.

Civil Service law in operation since Dec. 22, 1910.

Fiction. Moved from the main Lending Room on 2nd floor to separate
department on 1st floor Oct., 1912, for the convenience of borrowers.

High School Room, on 1st floor of Main Library. Contains books on the
required reading lists of the four high schools. Opened March 13, 1918,

be increased at that time.

officials, which adopted the suggestion of Mr. Frank J. Urquhart, of the

_Passaic Valley Trunk Sewer_: Passaic River became so polluted by the
sewage of Newark and other cities lying along its course from Paterson
south, that in 1896 a movement was started by Paterson and Newark
Boards of Trade, for the purification of the river. After 16 years of
litigation, 15 municipalities joined in building a great trunk sewer
to collect the sewage of towns in Passaic Valley District, carry it
across Newark Bay and discharge it into upper New York Bay. Work began
July, 1912, under direction of the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission,
authorized by act of N. J. Legislature, 1907. The cost, estimated at

_Prison Reform_: (Here are recorded a few facts about N. J. procedure,
selected because of their connection with the administration of law for
Newark. Complete review of state conditions and progress will be found
in the Report of the Prison Inquiry Commission, published 1917.)

Indeterminate Sentence: Or sentence to imprisonment without a fixed time
for its termination. Adopted by act of N. J. Legislature April 21, 1911.
Is in accordance with the principle that imprisonment is primarily for
reformation and that offenders should be released as soon as they have
shown themselves again ready to be fit members of society. Provides for
a maximum and minimum term, the maximum varying with nature of offense
and the minimum not less than a year and not more than two-thirds of the
maximum.

Prior to 1911 this practice had applied only to the State Reformatory.

Prison Labor: Law abolishing private contract system of labor directing
that work of convicts should be employed in manufacture of goods for
state-use was passed by N. J. Legislature, June 7, 1911. Prison Labor
Commission created March 28, 1912, to direct development of "state-use"
system and control its operation, but without sufficient authority to
assure its success. Act passed, April 4, 1913, provided that unfilled
contracts might be continued until state-use industries had been
established. In view of the practical failure to introduce "state-use"
system within the prisons, outside employment of prisoners was authorized
by act of April 11, 1910, and subsequent amendments. Since 1913, 4 road
camps have been opened for employment of convicts on state roads and
have proved a relative success. Farming has also proved profitable. This
system not only aims to prevent waste of state resources but to provide
industrial training for inmates of correctional institutions of the state.

Employment of county prisoners and payment of earnings to their families
was provided for by N. J. law passed 1915. Wardens of jails are
instructed to give preference to men serving terms for nonsupport. At
Essex Co. jail in Newark, $3,000 or $4,000 have thus been contributed to
prisoners' families otherwise left destitute. Benefits will increase as
practice is further systematized.

Probation System: Probation and suspended sentence first introduced by
act of Legislature, April 2, 1906. Authorizes courts and magistrates to
suspend sentence of persons convicted of criminal offenses, to release
them on probation and for such time and under such conditions as the

_250th Anniversary_: The first settlers, led by Robert Treat, came to
Newark from Connecticut, May 17, 1666. In 1916, from May 1 to Oct. 31,
the city celebrated its 250th birthday with a succession of ceremonies
and festivities.

Preliminary plans were laid in 1914, when the N. J. Legislature approved
an act, March 9, providing for such a celebration. In accordance with
this act, and by authority granted under an ordinance of the Common
Council, Mayor Haussling, in the summer of the same year, appointed
the Committee of One Hundred to raise money and plan, through its
sub-committees, for the anniversary program.

Newark and the forthcoming celebration became subjects of national
interest and importance. Thousands of people from all over the country
entered competitions for the best posters and poems, symbolizing the
city's history and industrial progress. The competitions resulted in the
spread of information about Newark and brought recognition of the city's
standing.

The most notable single feature of the anniversary was the Pageant of
Newark, an historic and allegorical review of the growth of the city,
presented in Weequahic Park.

There were innumerable parades, of which none was more pleasing to the
spectators, or more creditable to the city, than the School Children's
Parade, June 6.

Annual or recurrent events like the Music Festival and Industrial
Exposition were included in the anniversary program and made particularly
attractive.

230 athletes from all parts of the United States and Canada participated
in the athletic events held at Weequahic Park, September 8, 9 and 16, and
succeeded in breaking six world records. The Ninth International Fly and
Bait Casting Tournament, held in Newark, Aug. 23-26, was likewise a great
success. Athletic meets of all kinds were the order of the summer months.

As was natural, Newark became the popular convention city for 1916, all
manner of organizations being glad to avail themselves of the special
attractions offered their members.

_Vailsburg_: Annexed, Jan. 1, 1905. Area thus added, 885.1 acres or 1.383
sq. miles.


_Vehicular Tunnel_: Act giving power to the N. J. Inter-State Bridge
and Tunnel Commission, acting jointly with the N. Y. Commission, for
construction and operation of a tunnel for vehicular traffic under the
Hudson River, from New York to Jersey City, passed by both N. Y. and N.
J. Legislatures, 1919.

By this means traffic congestion will be relieved, difficulties of fog
and ice overcome to a great extent, freight handled more cheaply and
mails expedited. Interstate freight traffic will no longer be entirely
dependent on ferry and barge service, as was the case during the harbor
strike in the winter of 1918.

Gen. Goethals, builder of the Panama Canal, has estimated that a tunnel
wide enough to allow 3 trucks to travel side by side and providing for
a foot path will cost $12,000,000. Maintenance will amount to about
$125,000 annually. About 2 years will be required for construction.

As U. S. Congress has voted against federal aid, the expense will be met
jointly by New York and New Jersey.

an increase of over 101%. The following table for N. J. is included to

available, 50,000,000 gallons. Average daily consumption, 47,341,000
gallons.

For many years there has been agitation for new source of supply, as

the Capital Issues Committee of the Federal Reserve Board to proceed
with the development of the Wanaque watershed on condition that no
construction work be undertaken during the war. Supply from the Wanaque
watershed would be 50,000,000 gallons, equal capacity to Pequannock. Cost

Department, Whooping Cough". This is a measure to prevent the spread of
disease.


_Woman Suffrage_: In view of the recent adoption of the Susan B. Anthony
amendment by U. S. Congress, a review of the suffrage movement in N. J.
from earliest times to the present, may be of sufficient interest to
warrant the disregard of limiting dates.

_Young Men's Christian Association_: Since 1904 the Y. M. C. A. of this
city has added two stories over its gymnasium building, increasing its
capacity of living rooms for young men to 125.

which is to be the site for the annex building to be erected within the
next 5 years.

In the Educational Dept. there have been organized and conducted
the accountancy school, automobile schools, classes in electricity,
salesmanship, modern production methods, personal efficiency and memory
training.

A most important advance was made when the City-Wide Community Work was
organized in 1914. There are now 3 districts being operated. Eventually
the city and suburbs are to be organized with 7 distinct districts, each
with a competent secretary doing work for the whole community.


_Young Women's Christian Association_: New administration and recreation
building, 53 Washington St., opened Sept. 2, and dedicated Nov. 3, 1913.

garden, swimming pool, classrooms, and offices.

1917.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

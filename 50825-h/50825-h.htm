<p><b><i>This compilation is an attempt by a busy library
staff to put into form convenient for use a large group of
such facts and figures as experience shows are often asked
for. The notes which follow tell how we happen to be
so interested in Newark's story, why so many questions on
that story come to us, and what kind of help we hope
Newarkers may get from it.</i></b></p>
</div>

<p>About seventeen years ago the Library began to collect information
about Newark. We began with a search for good topical poetry
and for historical stories so written as to appeal to young people. Of
these we found very little; though poor verse and poor history were both
abundant.</p>

<p>Then we extended our search to the field of Newark as a going
concern. In this field we found so little in print that was fairly descriptive
of the actual Newark of the time, from water supply to sewers,
and from parks to jails, that we began to write it ourselves.</p>

<p>We were moved to do this largely because certain changes in school
work led many pupils and teachers to come to us for information. Our
brief, typed and multigraphed statements about subjects like the city
hospital, paving and street cleaning, proved to be very welcome. We
gathered a vast deal of Newark information and, in time, cast much of
it into convenient form for use in the Library and for lending. In these
days we held in the Library several annual exhibits illustrative of and
calling attention to events of both early and recent days in Newark's
history.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank J. Urquhart, one of the editors of the Newark Sunday
Call, had long been an advocate of the study of Newark by its citizens,
both old and young. At the request of the Library, he wrote a brief
history of Newark for the use of young people, which later the Board of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
Education adopted as a text-book in the schools. Mr. Urquhart helped
the Library very materially in the collection of historical data and in
exhibits of Newark life and customs in the past.</p>

<p>Several years ago the schools took over this Newark work and, of
course, vastly expanded it, and made of it a Course, running through
all grades, on the City of Newark, and supplied for it a text-book and
more than forty pamphlets of Newark information.</p>

<p>Dr. A. B. Poland, then Superintendent of our Schools, approved
heartily of all this Newark study work, and at his request Assistant
Superintendent J. Wilmer Kennedy prepared the Course of Study and
the pamphlets just mentioned.</p>

<p>The demand for Newark information which came to the Library
was, of course, rather increased than diminished by this adoption of a
Newark Study Course by the schools.</p>

<p>Moreover, Newark has now a much larger number of persons who
are interested in its development and its character and its recent self-improvement
than it had fifteen years ago. Consequently, the requests
received from adults for facts and figures concerning recent events in our
city are much more numerous than they were formerly.</p>

<p>Looking back over the world's history with the perspective of many
years, you would not find it an easy matter to select any fifteen-year
period about which you might wish to write even the briefest review.
That is, events appear to lose their importance or to produce unexpected
results with the passing years, and only a comparatively few happenings
remain conspicuous for all time and for all peoples.</p>

<p>There is, however, a peculiar fascination about history in the
making, and especially local history within one's own memory. Perhaps
it may be compared to the study of a dead language as an intellectual
pursuit and the study of a live language for the pleasure or profit of
human intercourse. Both are desirable&mdash;the one, as a background, the
other, as a foreground of education.</p>

<p>Newark's history from the days of Robert Treat was so thoroughly
reviewed at the time of the 250th Anniversary Celebration, 1916, that
we have elected to treat as background everything prior to 1904 and to
concern ourselves with the story of Newark from that year to the present.
This means that the high school graduate of June, 1919, should find
between the covers of this pamphlet a record of the city from the time
he or she entered the kindergarten. With these dates in mind it was
really astonishing to find how many changes and what material advances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">« 3 »</a></span>
had been made within the fifteen years. As you thought of the building
of the City Hall and Court House; the changed appearance of the
"Four Corners"; the opening of the Hudson and Manhattan Tubes;
the new Public Service Terminal; the adaptation of automatic appliances
in fire fighting; the impetus given movements like "Safety First",
vacant lot cultivation and thrift with its school banks; the bigger civic
undertakings like City Plan, Passaic Valley Sewer; Port Newark and
the unexpected trend of its development due to the war; the war itself,
representing the effect of a world event on a city's activities; the 250th
Anniversary, a local celebration, but illustrative of Newark's relations
with the outside world; and, finally, of the change of city administration
to Commission Government&mdash;you wonder whether history at close
range invariably presents so much of interest, or whether 1904-1919
happens to be a particularly progressive period, or whether Newark,
suddenly conscious of its backwardness in many lines, is now making
up for lost time.</p>

<p>So many facts presented themselves that the pamphlet soon outgrew
our original conception of it, becoming much larger than was originally
intended. It is still, however, a succession of facts and in no sense a
consecutive history. Because it grew from fact to fact, suggested by
one assistant and perhaps set down by another; and because from the
first day the idea was suggested to the day when work stopped, a lapse
of three months, we were daily expecting that copy must go to the
printer on the morrow, the entries are not as complete, or the whole as
well balanced as we should wish. One consideration which delayed
our work, but which should contribute to any value it may have, was
the fixed desire to avoid loose, indefinite statement and to resist the inclination
to make irrelevant comment when real information is wanting or
difficult to acquire. This determination grew as our own searches and
questionings showed how common is this looseness of statement. For
the facts and information which it was impossible or very difficult to get
from records on file, we wish to make grateful acknowledgment to city
departments, newspapers, societies and individuals who responded
promptly and graciously to our calls for assistance.</p>

according to carefully prepared plans; stopping all further random
development, all haphazard extensions, and all improvements for certain
favored sections or limited localities. It means considering every suggested
change or improvement as to its effect on the entire city and all
suburbs and nearby towns.</p>

<p>"City planning is for all, and especially for the man of modest
income. It means better housing and attractive and healthful surroundings

<p>"It means a City Efficient, a City Clean and a City Enjoyable."</p>

<p>An act providing for city plan commissions passed N. J. Legislature
and became a law March 30, 1911. On June 1, Mayor
Haussling appointed the Newark City Plan Commission. For its investigations

there were no further appropriations for special boards and the City
Plan Commission went out of existence, Dec. 31, 1917.</p>

<p>Some of the subjects studied and reported on by the Commission

evening schools, and continued as such, until 1906, when it was decided
to have the lectures for the people given in school buildings, designated
as lecture centers. In 1907 there were 15 lecture centers, including
the First Presbyterian Church, the Free Public Library and 13 school
buildings.</p>

<p>During the season of 1907-08 there were 245 lectures with a
total attendance of 105,210. For the season 1915-16 there were 30
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span>
centers and 400 lectures, with an aggregate attendance of 160,890.
During the war period, 1917-18, the attendance decreased.</p>

<p>Subjects treated in the lectures are history, patriotism, art, music,
literature and geography. Many are illustrated by stereopticon views
and a few by motion pictures. Musical programs have always proved
popular.</p>


<p class="p0"><a id="Library_Public" name="Library_Public"></a><i>Library, Public</i>: Building completed, March, 1901. Cost of building,
$315,000; cost of land, $100,000. Architects, Rankin &amp; Kellogg,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Number of books lent in 1904, 465,674. In 1911 the number
passed the million mark and held it until, in 1918, the library's income
was found to be inadequate, branch libraries were closed, and the number
of books lent dropped, accordingly, 37%.</p>

<p>Art Department and Picture Collection, which were getting well
under way in 1904 and lent 3,000 pictures that year, now lend over
100,000 small pictures, photographs, lithographs and prints. These
pictures are used by teachers in 36 different schools for classroom work;
also by artists, designers, jewelers, newspapers and journals, advertising
men and others in trades and professions, needing illustrative
material.</p>

<p>Barringer High School Branch. Opened, 1900, under management
of Public Library. Management taken over by Bd. of Education
and books purchased from the Public Library, 1915.</p>

<p>Business Branch. First opened in 1904 at 16 Academy St.,
with a collection of directories and a general book collection. First
public library of business literature and information for business men
ever established. Similar branches have since been established by
libraries of other large cities. During the 15 years it moved 4 times,
always near the business center at Broad and Market Streets, and special
development along business lines has been steadily carried on.</p>

<p>Branch Libraries, General. Delivery stations were the Library's
first attempt to reach people in sections distant from the main building.
They were opened in drug stores at various centers as early as 1891 and
were intended only for the collection and delivery of books borrowed by
people in the neighborhood. Readers left their cards with a list of call
numbers, taken from the old "finding list" or printed catalog. Requests
were filled at the Library and books delivered to the station daily.</p>

<p>In 1906, because of increased use, delivery stations were replaced
by deposit stations. At these deposit stations, still operated in stores,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
the Library placed collections of several hundred books and continued
the delivery system. When the lending of books outgrew deposit
stations, branch libraries were the natural result. After branches were
established, deposit stations were discontinued, Nov., 1914.</p>

<p>From 1905 to 1915, seven general branches in rented stores and
two school branches, were opened for the convenience of residents in
neighborhoods two or more miles from the main library. All branches
closed in 1918 because of insufficient funds to carry on the work, which
had grown to large proportions. For notes about branches, see
chronological "Story of the Branches", in pamphlet "The Roseville
Branch", published 1917.</p>

<p>Children's Books. The Children's Room at the Main Library
always has a special collection of children's books to lend to children
who live near enough to visit it. The branch libraries lent books also
to children in their neighborhoods. The School Dept. sends to any
teacher who wishes it, a school or classroom library of 25-40 books
to lend to the children in her class. 400 or 500 of these libraries go
into schools every year and 15,000 children read the books.</p>

<p>Civil Service law in operation since Dec. 22, 1910.</p>

<p>Fiction. Moved from the main Lending Room on 2nd floor to
separate department on 1st floor Oct., 1912, for the convenience of
borrowers.</p>

<p>High School Room, on 1st floor of Main Library. Contains
books on the required reading lists of the four high schools. Opened
March 13, 1918, for convenience of high school students. The whole
Library is open to them for general use as before.</p>

<p>"The Library and the Museum Therein," first issued June 28,
1918. An eight page journal, illustrated, describing the activities and
acquisitions of Library and Museum. Five numbers have appeared to

<p class="p0"><a id="Newark" name="Newark"></a><i>Newark Day</i>: For the purpose of studying history and development
of Newark, Nov. 7, 1910, the day before Election Day, was set aside
by Bd. of Education. At the board meeting, Oct. 27, 1910, it was
recommended that principals and teachers and, whenever possible, citizens
and officials lecture to the pupils about the city in which they live.
The day before Election Day was chosen because local interest would
naturally be increased at that time.</p>

<p>Since then interest in the day has grown through the action of the
Schoolmen's Club, composed of men teachers, principals and educational
officials, which adopted the suggestion of Mr. Frank J. Urquhart,
of the Newark Sunday Call, to mark by tablets important historical
spots in the city.</p>

<p class="p0"><a id="Prison_Reform" name="Prison_Reform"></a><i>Prison Reform</i>: (Here are recorded a few facts about N. J. procedure,
selected because of their connection with the administration of
law for Newark. Complete review of state conditions and progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
will be found in the Report of the Prison Inquiry Commission, published
1917.)</p>


<p>Indeterminate Sentence: Or sentence to imprisonment without a fixed
time for its termination. Adopted by act of N. J. Legislature April
21, 1911. Is in accordance with the principle that imprisonment is
primarily for reformation and that offenders should be released as soon
as they have shown themselves again ready to be fit members of society.
Provides for a maximum and minimum term, the maximum varying with
nature of offense and the minimum not less than a year and not more
than two-thirds of the maximum.</p>

<p>Prior to 1911 this practice had applied only to the State Reformatory.</p>


<p class="p0">Prison Labor: Law abolishing private contract system of labor directing
that work of convicts should be employed in manufacture of goods
for state-use was passed by N. J. Legislature, June 7, 1911. Prison
Labor Commission created March 28, 1912, to direct development of
"state-use" system and control its operation, but without sufficient
authority to assure its success. Act passed, April 4, 1913, provided
that unfilled contracts might be continued until state-use industries had
been established. In view of the practical failure to introduce "state-use"
system within the prisons, outside employment of prisoners was
authorized by act of April 11, 1910, and subsequent amendments.
Since 1913, 4 road camps have been opened for employment of convicts
on state roads and have proved a relative success. Farming has
also proved profitable. This system not only aims to prevent waste of
state resources but to provide industrial training for inmates of correctional
institutions of the state.</p>

<p>Employment of county prisoners and payment of earnings to
their families was provided for by N. J. law passed 1915. Wardens
of jails are instructed to give preference to men serving terms for nonsupport.
At Essex Co. jail in Newark, $3,000 or $4,000 have thus
been contributed to prisoners' families otherwise left destitute. Benefits
will increase as practice is further systematized.</p>

<p class="p0">Probation System: Probation and suspended sentence first introduced
by act of Legislature, April 2, 1906. Authorizes courts and magistrates
to suspend sentence of persons convicted of criminal offenses, to
release them on probation and for such time and under such conditions
as the court determines instead of imposing penalty provided by the law.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">« 32 »</a></span>
Reformatory for Women, N. J. State: At Clinton Farms, Hunterdon
Co. Provided for by act of N. J. Legislature, 1910. Opened Jan.,
1913. To which the criminal court judges may, at their discretion,
send females about the age of 17, who have committed a State Prison
offense. Aims to return women to a self-respecting, self-supporting life.
All commitments are for an indefinite term limited only by the maximum
period of imprisonment fixed by law.</p>

<p class="p0">Social Investigation: Investigation of social facts regarding prisoners
to be sentenced and circumstances attending Crime was begun in 1908.
Made part of probation office work. No sentence is now passed by
Essex Co. Court judge until a written statement of all such facts has
been presented. Judge no longer tries to make the punishment fit the
crime but to make the punishment fit the prisoner and restore him to his
normal place in society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span></p>

<p>Complying with this law, N. J. Dept. of Public Instruction issued
a monograph for use in schools on "Dangers and Safeguards," Feb.,
1915. Prepared in collaboration with Newark Bur. of Combustibles
and Fire Risks, Public Service Corporation, Employers' Liability Commission
and State Bd. of Health, teaches how fires may be prevented,
many street and railway accidents avoided, industrial workers safeguarded,
diseases combated and first aid administered.</p>

<p>Law providing that no vehicle should travel at a greater speed
than six miles an hour when approaching a schoolhouse, provided signs
easily visible were placed on the highway, indicating school locations,
passed by N. J. Legislature, April 6, 1915.</p>

<p>Public Service Corporation furthered "Safely First" campaign by
talks in public and parochial schools, May, 1915.</p>

<p>Public School Safety Patrol established April, 1917. A member
of the city police force has charge of this work under attendance
department of Bd. of Education. Members are appointed each term

<p class="p0"><a id="Anniversary_250th" name="Anniversary_250th"></a><i>250th Anniversary</i>: The first settlers, led by Robert Treat, came to
Newark from Connecticut, May 17, 1666. In 1916, from May 1 to
Oct. 31, the city celebrated its 250th birthday with a succession of
ceremonies and festivities.</p>

<p>Preliminary plans were laid in 1914, when the N. J. Legislature
approved an act, March 9, providing for such a celebration. In accordance
with this act, and by authority granted under an ordinance of the
Common Council, Mayor Haussling, in the summer of the same year,
appointed the Committee of One Hundred to raise money and plan,
through its sub-committees, for the anniversary program.</p>

<p>Newark and the forthcoming celebration became subjects of
national interest and importance. Thousands of people from all over
the country entered competitions for the best posters and poems, symbolizing
the city's history and industrial progress. The competitions
resulted in the spread of information about Newark and brought recognition
of the city's standing.</p>

<p>The most notable single feature of the anniversary was the Pageant
of Newark, an historic and allegorical review of the growth of the
city, presented in Weequahic Park.</p>

<p>There were innumerable parades, of which none was more pleasing
to the spectators, or more creditable to the city, than the School
Children's Parade, June 6.</p>

<p>Annual or recurrent events like the Music Festival and Industrial
Exposition were included in the anniversary program and made particularly
attractive.</p>

<p>230 athletes from all parts of the United States and Canada
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
participated in the athletic events held at Weequahic Park, September
8, 9 and 16, and succeeded in breaking six world records. The Ninth
International Fly and Bait Casting Tournament, held in Newark, Aug.
23-26, was likewise a great success. Athletic meets of all kinds were
the order of the summer months.</p>

<p>As was natural, Newark became the popular convention city for
1916, all manner of organizations being glad to avail themselves of the
special attractions offered their members.</p>

<p class="p0"><a id="Vehicular_Tunnel" name="Vehicular_Tunnel"></a><i>Vehicular Tunnel</i>: Act giving power to the N. J. Inter-State Bridge
and Tunnel Commission, acting jointly with the N. Y. Commission, for
construction and operation of a tunnel for vehicular traffic under the
Hudson River, from New York to Jersey City, passed by both N. Y.
and N. J. Legislatures, 1919.</p>

<p>By this means traffic congestion will be relieved, difficulties of fog
and ice overcome to a great extent, freight handled more cheaply and
mails expedited. Interstate freight traffic will no longer be entirely
dependent on ferry and barge service, as was the case during the harbor
strike in the winter of 1918.</p>

<p>Gen. Goethals, builder of the Panama Canal, has estimated that
a tunnel wide enough to allow 3 trucks to travel side by side and providing
for a foot path will cost $12,000,000. Maintenance will
amount to about $125,000 annually. About 2 years will be required
for construction.</p>

be met jointly by New York and New Jersey.</p>

with the development of the Wanaque watershed on condition that
no construction work be undertaken during the war. Supply from the
Wanaque watershed would be 50,000,000 gallons, equal capacity to

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
